# Dynamic-weapon-target-assignment
Abstract—T The traditional dynamic weapon target assignment model has a significant limitation: it assigns weapons to targets in multiple static stages, without considering changes in target threats that may occur between stages. To address this issue, this paper proposes a "time sampling dynamic weapon assignment model" that divides the decision-making process into intervals, capturing real-time changes in target threats and enabling timely decisions. A dynamic assignment method using reinforcement learning is developed and tested through comparative experiments, optimizing sampling time divisions and evaluating performance against traditional heuristic algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model and reinforcement learning algorithm significantly outperform traditional methods in terms of decision-making timeliness and global considerations.
Keywords— Dynamic weapon target assignment, simulation model, reinforcement learning, heuristic algorithm, PPO algorithm.
